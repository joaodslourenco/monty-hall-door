This project consists on the classic gameshow Monty Hall's Door. The participant must choose a door to have a chance to win a prize. Once the participant chooses certain door, the host of the show opens a different door and asks if the participant still wants to stick with the first choice or change to another. Once the participant decides, the host opens the door and reveals if he is the winner.
